* [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/) - an open source, BSD-licensed library providing high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools for the Python programming language.

* [path library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html) - for utilizing filesystem paths with semantics appropriate for different operating systems.

* [numpy](https://numpy.org/doc/) - a Python library that provides a multidimensional array object, various derived objects (such as masked arrays and matrices), and an assortment of routines for fast operations on arrays, including mathematical, logical, shape manipulation, sorting, selecting, I/O, discrete Fourier transforms, basic linear algebra, basic statistical operations, random simulation and much more.

## Usage

The application uses the closing prices of Bitcoin on Bitstamp and Coinbase from December 31, 2015 through January 7, 2019.  It compares the spread between the two exchange in early, middle and late part of the period.  The application quantifies the arbitrage opportunities during each segment of the period by selecting a date in each of the time segment.  The conclusion is that the arbitrage opportunities were more abundant in the early segment of the period and became fully explored, leaving little artitrage opportunities toward the end of the period.
